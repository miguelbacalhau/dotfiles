# Bacalhau Neovim install

### Description
This is a basic shell script to install my neovim configuration and plugins

### Requirements

Install vim *(Outdated)* or neovim in your system.

### Installation

#### NeoVim
Just run the script
``` sh

#### Vim *(Outdated)*
I no longer use vim, and the configurations are outdated.
However the install script should still work
